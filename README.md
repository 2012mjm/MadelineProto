PHP implementation of MTProto, based on [telepy](https://github.com/griganton/telepy_old).

This project can run on PHP 7, PHP 5.6 and HHVM.  

This is a WIP.
Here all of the things that still have to be done in this library.  
You can (and you are also encouraged to) contribute by completing any of the following points.  
The importance of each item will range from 1 to 5. It's better to start from the most important items.

* In Session.php, complete the function that creates the authorization key (5).
* In Crypto.php or aes256.php, choose which of the ige implementation to use and complete it (4).
* In Session.php and TL, manage rpc errors, notifications, error codes and basically everything that isn't a normal response (4).
* In Connection.php and Session.php, add support for http, https and (maybe) udp connections and fix tcp intermediate connections (3).
* In API.php, complete a decent authorization flow that supports both bots and normal users (2).
* In PrimeModule.php, fix the mess in it, choose one of (the fastest) native php prime factorization function and implement it without biginteger (1.5).


The name of this project is inspired by [this person](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f0/a1/70/f0a170718baeb0e3817c612d96f5d1cf.jpg).
