# MadelineProto

PHP implementation of MTProto, converted from [telepy](https://github.com/griganton/telepy) using [py2php](https://github.com/dan-da/py2php).  

This is a WIP.

The name of this project is inspired by [this person](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f0/a1/70/f0a170718baeb0e3817c612d96f5d1cf.jpg), due to the obvious signs of madness this project has in common with her.

I use PHP and I think that's absolutely fucking stupid.
