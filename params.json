It's better to start from the most important items.\r\n\r\n* In Session.php, complete the function that creates the authorization key, in particular try to figure out what's wrong with the req_DH_params query (5).\r\n* In Crypto.php or aes256.php, choose which of the ige implementation to use and complete it (4).\r\n* In Session.php and TL, manage rpc errors, notifications, error codes and basically everything that isn't a normal response (4).\r\n* In Connection.php and Session.php, add support for http, https and (maybe) udp connections and fix tcp intermediate connections (3).\r\n* In API.php, complete a decent authorization flow that supports both bots and normal users (2).\r\n* In PrimeModule.php, fix the mess in it, choose one of (the fastest) native php prime factorization function and implement it without biginteger (1.5).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project requires PHP 7 and a 64 bit machine. \r\n\r\nThe name of this project is inspired by [this person](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f0/a1/70/f0a170718baeb0e3817c612d96f5d1cf.jpg).\r\n",
